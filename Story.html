  <h4>
    Robot Revolution
  </h4>
  <p>
  The year is 2106. Robots and humans have become equals in society,
  which occurred when the World Federation of Artificial Intelligence passed the Robot Equality Act in 2095.
   However, as mankind continues to deplete the Earth of its renewable energy, conflict breaks out.
   On Earth, there is only one remaining oil reserve.
  The globe is divided: the Eastern Hemisphere wishes to save the oil in time of great need, but the Western Hemisphere wished to use it to fuel research into new energy sources.
  Both men and robots divided and war broke out.
